   Before I did any research, I barely knew anything about microbits, since we focused so little on them. However after researching a little I came up with a good idea, I had 10 ideas at the start, but that is just a formality, I never even considered any of the other ideas. Then we narrowed the ideas down to 4, and I chose the best one, which was the one that I had already had chosen by the very start. I had the idea first back in 4th or 5th year, we were required to do a project for either computer science or accounting, and I had the idea since it was a problem in my own life, my privacy is important to me so I wanted a way to lock the door from my bed when I sleep, or to lock it from the inside when Im not in my room. You would think I could just use a key, but there is no key. So I thought up the solution of having a remote controlled lock that used gears in order to slide a bar of metal across the door gap and into a holder, like the ones that gates/fences have, except without the "up and over"

      After working with the microbit and firebase and whatnot, I realised that my idea was far more complicated than I had the skill to make. So I decided on just making a simple heating system that would turn on the heating if the temperature is below a certain number, and turn it off if it reached a desired temperature. The 'turning on' would be signified by a constant green LED  being on, and when the heating was 'off' there would be a red LED that was turned on, and the green would be turned off.
