  <h4>
    At first I had a lot of ideas, I will list them all after this paragraph. Anyway at first I had 10 ideas, those 10 were wittled down with the gift of hind-sight, most of the ideas were absurd or stupid. The 10 ideas were wittled down to 4, the 4 were then thought over and contemplated, which one was the simplest and easiest to implement? I decided on going with a slightly more complicated project, and in return I might even be able to use it in my own life. The idea was a servo that could be remotely triggered to serve as a lock. The targeted audience was teens who wanted privacy, disabled people who didn't want to make the hassle of locking the door every night, old people with fragile bones, etc. The mistake was thinking that I could make all that in such a limited time, and underestimating the complicated nature of the project. I think I would've been able to get it working if I didn't have to work with firebase, and If I could focus solely on the microbit aspect and troubleshooting that. But life doesn't always work the way you want it to, and so I had to downgrade my idea and quickly whip up a working prototype so we could film it and hand it in. My original idea was a dozen times better, but also a dozen times harder to do.   
</h4>
    
<h5>
      List of 10 ideas:
    </h5>
    <h4>
Idea 1 :
A motion detector used as an alert system so that you’re informed if someone enters your room when you aren’t at home. This could be useful for people who value their privacy, teenagers to confront their parents on why they break into their room while they aren’t home, or for people who live with a roommate and to serve as proof that they entered the room. It could send an alert to your phone, or simply have a log that details if someone entered or not that you can check once you arrive at home.

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
      
Idea 2:
A remote controlled locking mechanism that can be activated with the website/a remote/an app. Useful for lazy people who don't want to get up in the middle of the night if they forgot to lock their door, useful for people who don't own a key to their rooms, can be a workaround for a lost key. Useful for a lot more people and reasons that you can probably come up with.Like a crippled person who can't lock their door

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
Idea 3:
A dog collar with a GPS that has set boundaries, the dog collar can be used to locate/train the dog if you don't have fences and don't want your dog to run off. Could use a small shock every time the dog goes outside the boundaries to train them.

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
      Idea 4:
A quick reminder system that you can press a button on to buzz in a certain time. There could be a total of 3 or 4 buttons, 1 button adds 10 seconds, button 2 adds 1 minute, button 3 adds 10 minutes and button 4 resets the timer. If you need to be reminded of something but cant be bothered to take out your phone and set a timer you could use the reminder instantly by just clicking a few buttons.

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
      Idea 5:
A ‘good parent system’ where you can have a motion detector or some other detector to make sure that your kid was not playing games after a certain time. It could send an alert or raise an alarm if it detects a child moving near their laptop/pc, or if it detects that the computer was turned on. 

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
      Idea 6:
Sensor for counting people in a room, and raises an alarm when there are too many people for safety in regards to covid.

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
      Idea 7:
Remote controlled blinds/window opener 2 in one.


    </h4>
    
<h4>
  Idea 8:
Flood detector, self explanatory. Would need to waterproof

    </h4>    
    
    <h4>
      Idea 9:
Door bells that flash very brightly throughout the entire house for deaf people so that they know someone is at their door, or an app that vibrates their phone when someone rings the doorbell.

    </h4>
    
    <h4>
     Idea 10: A lock that automatically locks itself at a certain time, i.e you forgot to lock the door when you go to sleep. (What if you get locked out???)
    </h4>
    
    <h5>
      4 Ideas I chose to investigate
    </h5>
    
    <h4>
     1: Intruder detection alarm 
I like this idea because of the usefulness of it.
This problem could solve break ins or intruders .
The target audience is homeowners who own a lot of precious/ expensive items e.g a family heirloom.
There are no moral or ethical problems with this idea.
The system will work by using motion detection and counting how many people have come into the house, If there is an intruder the system will make a loud annoying noise alerting anyone nearby
The only problem with this is that it would be difficult to implement, while also being pointless as home security devices already exist, they are called burglar alarms and they are a lot better than mine will ever be.
    </h4>
    
    <h4>
     2: Light doorbell rather than sound
The target audience is deaf people who can’t hear
The problem will solve deaf people not being able to hear the doorbell being rung
There are no moral or ethical problems with this idea.
The idea will work by pressing a button and a bright light will flash up at a low speed, the noise of the doorbell will also be there but this is an added feature.

    </h4>
    
    
    <h4>
     3: A remote locking system that can be controlled with radio signals or blutooth. This lock would also be equipped with a motion sensor that can be used to track if people enter a room, and at what time they enter. This can be useful for a lot of people. Paranoid people, crippled people who have stairs they need to climb and go down in order to lock their door, elderly, lazy people, teenagers, and probably anyone who wants a little extra security. The problem with this idea is the fact that making it be able to be remote controlled is difficult, the idea is too much work for something that we cannot even bring home. The complexity is having a servo, motion sensor, clock function, and a receiver of some sort all in one package. It is simply too difficult to make and demonstrate, especially with firebase being a part of the project.
    </h4>
    
    <h4>
    4: The simplest but also the most widely useable idea, a simple microbit that senses room temperature and either turns the heating on, or turns it off. The target audiance is anyone who lives inside a house. The code for it is relatively simple, and the project overall is very worth doing.
    </h4>
    
  <h4>
    After working with the microbit and firebase and whatnot, I realised that my idea was far more complicated than I had the skill to make. So I decided on just making a simple heating system that would turn on the heating if the temperature is below a certain number, and turn it off if it reached a desired temperature. The 'turning on' would be signified by a constant green LED  being on, and when the heating was 'off' there would be a red LED that was turned on, and the green would be turned off.
    </h4>
  
  <h4>
    Another thing that was a bit of a problem was setting up firebase and all, it was a challenge to say the least. My .html files on glitch are also named extremely oddly, please ignore that, this was originally going to be another website, and I kind of retrofitted it to become my reporting website, it all works, its just named oddly. I did try to change it once but realised that changing the titles would require me to change it in each and every single file, five times each time, about twelve times. This would probably cause other glitches that I wouldn't be unaware of until I stumbled upon them, so I just decided to have them remain the same. I was going to take screenshots of each version of the website, as it developed, going from basically nothing, going to errors, revisions before finally arriving at its current state, but all the saved screenshots were lost. It would've been nice to have but unfortunatly Its not possible anymore.
